# Cards Against AI - Backend Development Handover

## Key Learnings

### 1. Importance of Detailed Specifications
Having a clear and detailed specification document is crucial for guiding the implementation process and ensuring all requirements are met.

### 2. Iterative Development
The process of implementing, reviewing, and refining the codebase highlighted the importance of iterative development in catching and correcting inconsistencies.

### 3. Integration Challenges
Integrating multiple services (database, Redis, Anthropic API) requires careful planning and error handling to ensure robust operation.

### 4. Testing Complexities
Mocking external services, especially newer APIs like Anthropic, can be challenging and requires a good understanding of the service's behavior.

### 5. Alignment of API, Services, and Data Models
Ensuring consistency between the API endpoints, service implementations, and data model is crucial for a coherent system.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Initial Planning
More time could have been spent on initial planning to better align the implementation with the specifications from the start.

### 2. Documentation
Earlier and more comprehensive documentation of the API endpoints and service functionalities could have prevented some inconsistencies.

### 3. Error Handling
A more systematic approach to error handling across all services could have been implemented from the beginning.

### 4. Testing Strategy
A more comprehensive testing strategy, including integration tests, could have been planned and implemented earlier in the development process.
